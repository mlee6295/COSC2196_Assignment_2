<h1>Team_Name_404 Group Reflection</h1>

<p><pre>I think our group was able to be really respectful of each other’s opinions and ideas. We were able to schedule regular meetings on MS Teams and talk through each step and how to best break down the tasks. I found that I was motivated by the other member’s contributions to keep up to a high standard of work to match theirs. 
Improvement could be made in recognizing which members are able to deliver certain tasks as needed for the rest of the group members’ standards. 
I was really happy to be able to develop a good dynamic with the group, considering we were only able to meet face to face and connect on webcam/audio. I was apprehensive going into a group assignment about how it would work, but found it not so scary – instead it was definitely fun at times and I really enjoyed getting to know each member of the group. 
Each member had a different strength and skills they brought to the group. By learning more about them, the work was able to be divided up effectively. I learnt that it is ok to let others take on tasks and that it was possible for me to let go and not be so much of a crazy micro-manager. It was actually nice to know that I could trust others to share the workload. 
I think we had a good consistent communication on MS Teams for chat and bouncing ideas and developing our work further. We then moved our word documents and photos over to Github. I think both these platforms show a good reflection on the work that we put in as a team to the finished assignment.
