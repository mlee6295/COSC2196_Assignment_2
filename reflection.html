<h1><center>Team_Name_404 Group Reflection</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2><font face= font-family:"Helvetica, sans-serif">Rebecca Watson: </font></h2>
<p>I think our group was able to be really respectful of each other’s opinions and ideas. We were able to schedule regular meetings on MS Teams and talk through each step and how to best break down the tasks. I found that I was motivated by the other member’s contributions to keep up to a high standard of work to match theirs.</p>
<p>Improvement could be made in recognizing which members are able to deliver certain tasks as needed for the rest of the group members’ standards. Being very specific on assigning jobs for the assignments going forward, will also help the group keep on track, as there are so many parts that make up the finished product for submission.</p>
<p>I was really happy to be able to develop a good dynamic with the majority of the group, considering we were only able to meet face to face and connect on webcam/audio. I was apprehensive going into a group assignment about how it would work, but found it not so scary – instead it was definitely fun at times and I really enjoyed getting to know most members of the group.</p>
<p>Each member had a different strength and skills they brought to the group. By learning more about them, the work was able to be divided up effectively. I learnt that it is ok to let others take on tasks and that it was possible for me to let go and not be so much of a crazy micro-manager. It was actually nice to know that I could trust others to share the workload. </p>
<p>I think we had a good consistent communication on MS Teams for chat and bouncing ideas and developing our work further. We then moved our word documents and photos over to Github. I think both these platforms show a good reflection on the work that we put in as a team to the finished assignment.

  <h2>Paul Eccarius:</h2>
    <p>A boss once told me that group assignments are a microcosm reflection of the workplace – the good, the bad and the in-between. Taken through that lens, this assignment delivered in spades.</p>
    <p>I really enjoyed working with the majority of the team -  those that contributed were engaged, reliable and delivered work that made me try harder to make sure I was up to scratch. With a lot of things, we were very quickly on the same page, executing the same vision. I’m grateful to have been in such a great team. That said, that engagement was not universal and there were challenges in having everyone contribute – again, perhaps a reflection of what to expect beyond university.</p>
    <p>With no clear leader role apparent from our personality type-testing results in Assignment 1, we elected to rotate leadership, each taking a turn at chairing meetings and taking minutes, with division of labour and decisions being made collectively. In hindsight, this approach was perhaps Utopian and I found myself falling into a bit more of a ‘driving’ role in keeping us on track with the deadline. I put this down more to my experience in my current job rather than a personality aptitude. For future assignments, I think electing a ‘team leader’ is probably a worthwhile alternative – I was worried about perhaps seeming to take too much control. I’ll be very interested to read the other’s thoughts around this.</p>
    <p>These observations reflect my learning on groups – we each play a group role and exploiting these skills will likely yield better results than equality for equality’s sake. Overall however the group found it’s groove early and worked together really well. I’m looking forward to developing our Project in the coming assignments.</p>
<br>
   <h2>Martin:</h2>
  <p>I believe overall our group did a great job. Most of us were able to pull our own weights and contribute large amounts to this assessment and all the tasks required. We were all able to work very well with each other and delegate tasks accordingly.</p>
  <p>An improvement towards establishing roles early and assigning equal amounts of workload along with consistent communication from all members would have made things run a lot more smoothly.</p>
  <p>I was very surprised at the level of intellect, professionalism, and punctuality everyone displayed to meet deadlines and delivering high quality work. Another surprise I was personally amazed at was Nour. Despite being in another continent with a 10-hour time difference, she was still able to provide great work, especially towards the meeting with an IT professional and scheduling a time to conduct that meeting.</p>
  <p>From working as a group, I was able to learn about how challenging and rewarding it is when you collaborate with a bunch of strangers at first. But over time after meeting weekly and setting out tasks for each of us, we were able to perceive each other’s strengths and weaknesses and help each other out where the other may lack.</p>
