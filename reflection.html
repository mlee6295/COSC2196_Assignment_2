<h1><center>Team_Name_404 Group Reflection</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2><font face= font-family:"Helvetica, sans-serif">Rebecca Watson: </font></h2>
<p>I think our group was able to be really respectful of each other’s opinions and ideas. We were able to schedule regular meetings on MS Teams and talk through each step and how to best break down the tasks. I found that I was motivated by the other member’s contributions to keep up to a high standard of work to match theirs.</p>
<p>Improvement could be made in recognizing which members are able to deliver certain tasks as needed for the rest of the group members’ standards. Being very specific on assigning jobs for the assignments going forward, will also help the group keep on track, as there are so many parts that make up the finished product for submission.</p>
<p>I was really happy to be able to develop a good dynamic with the majority of the group, considering we were only able to meet face to face and connect on webcam/audio. I was apprehensive going into a group assignment about how it would work, but found it not so scary – instead it was definitely fun at times and I really enjoyed getting to know most members of the group.</p>
<p>Each member had a different strength and skills they brought to the group. By learning more about them, the work was able to be divided up effectively. I learnt that it is ok to let others take on tasks and that it was possible for me to let go and not be so much of a crazy micro-manager. It was actually nice to know that I could trust others to share the workload. </p>
<p>I think we had a good consistent communication on MS Teams for chat and bouncing ideas and developing our work further. We then moved our word documents and photos over to Github. I think both these platforms show a good reflection on the work that we put in as a team to the finished assignment.
</p>

<br>
  <h2>Paul Eccarius:</h2>
    <p>A boss once told me that group assignments are a microcosm reflection of the workplace – the good, the bad and the in-between. Taken through that lens, this assignment delivered in spades.</p>
    <p>I really enjoyed working with the majority of the team -  those that contributed were engaged, reliable and delivered work that made me try harder to make sure I was up to scratch. With a lot of things, we were very quickly on the same page, executing the same vision. I’m grateful to have been in such a great team. That said, that engagement was not universal and there were challenges in having everyone contribute – again, perhaps a reflection of what to expect beyond university.</p>
    <p>With no clear leader role apparent from our personality type-testing results in Assignment 1, we elected to rotate leadership, each taking a turn at chairing meetings and taking minutes, with division of labour and decisions being made collectively. In hindsight, this approach was perhaps Utopian and I found myself falling into a bit more of a ‘driving’ role in keeping us on track with the deadline. I put this down more to my experience in my current job rather than a personality aptitude. For future assignments, I think electing a ‘team leader’ is probably a worthwhile alternative – I was worried about perhaps seeming to take too much control. I’ll be very interested to read the other’s thoughts around this.</p>
    <p>These observations reflect my learning on groups – we each play a group role and exploiting these skills will likely yield better results than equality for equality’s sake. Overall however the group found it’s groove early and worked together really well. I’m looking forward to developing our Project in the coming assignments.</p>
<br>
   <h2>Martin Lee:</h2>
  <p>I believe overall our group did a great job. Most of us were able to pull our own weights and contribute large amounts to this assessment and all the tasks required. We were all able to work very well with each other and delegate tasks accordingly.</p>
  <p>An improvement towards establishing roles early and assigning equal amounts of workload along with consistent communication from all members would have made things run a lot more smoothly.</p>
  <p>I was very surprised at the level of intellect, professionalism, and punctuality everyone displayed to meet deadlines and delivering high quality work. Another surprise I was personally amazed at was Nour. Despite being in another continent with a 10-hour time difference, she was still able to provide great work, especially towards the meeting with an IT professional and scheduling a time to conduct that meeting.</p>
  <p>From working as a group, I was able to learn about how challenging and rewarding it is when you collaborate with a bunch of strangers at first. But over time after meeting weekly and setting out tasks for each of us, we were able to perceive each other’s strengths and weaknesses and help each other out where the other may lack.</p>
<br>
   <h2>Nour Zeroual:</h2>
  <p>Working together in harmony was one of the things that my group excelled at. We collaborated successfully. We were aware of each other's strengths and ensured that they were used properly to complete tasks on time.</p>
  <p>It has been a successful team and no major improvements are needed but what could have been better is being able to distribute work equally. Moreover I believe that one member could have cooperated better. No member should be pressed by the workload. Some tasks may need two people to complete while others may require three, so roles should have been assigned accordingly.</p>
  <p>What surprised me is that despite being on the other side of the world I managed to organise my schedule with my team members. I was able to overcome the inconveniences that might happen concerning the timing difference between Morocco and Australia. What impressed me more is the level of creativity and the quality of work we have performed.</p>
  <p>I learned that communication skills are valuable in this role, because I have benefited a lot from the way we communicate with each other in the aim of producing a refined and satisfying work. I also learned that working in a homogeneous way is very beneficial and rewarding.</p>
<br>
   <h2>Jarrad Hofman-Agar:</h2>
    <p>The teams work ethic was extremely high with high standards which is a nice to be a part of, but incredibly high team standards are hard to manage personally with some condescending comments. To begin with the team’s chat was semi effective but incredibly lacking the true versatility the app can give the user/team.</p>
    <p>The only way the team could see messages was thru the activity feed in different channels instead of using the channels as sole file dump which would mean finding messages and links would not be as hard.</p>
    <p>Being able to communicate thru the application from over seas also adds another layer of complication due to the time zone differences but the time zones did not play any real effect in people missing the group meeting.</p>
    <p>Me personally I wish I had the previous experience on GitHub but due to having a computer so old it could not code effectively and had to learn some in a shorter time span. The group has been good to work with, but I hope we improve our level of communication In the future and make it easier instead of throwing last minute changes in without telling someone before that change.</p>
<br>
<h2 align="center">Key Group Takeaways</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>On the whole, the team reflections all recognise similar strengths and opportunities - this in itself is a more encouraging result than four wildly differing views on how the assignment was completed!</li>
    <li>Everybody recognised the high quality of work delivered and mostly felt motivated to put their best effort forward.</li>
    <li>Using the collaborative tools Microsoft Teams & GitHub proved to be mostly seamless - a point highlighted by the fact no two team members lived in the same city. Nour gets a special shoutout here for dialling in from Rabat in Morocco - a complete non-issue in the execution of the tasks and in particular, her conducting the interview with someone from the other side of the world.</li>
    <li>While communication was high in context of the weekly/bi-weekly video calls, which everyone attended, an opportunity definitely presents itself for better use of Teams. We broke the different tasks into channels and this probably introduced unnecessary confusion into where comments and files belonged. As the team becomes more familiar and comfortable with GitHub as a collaborative platform, leaning more into this can potentially make this workflow clearer.</li>
    <li>Attempting to execute the assignment ‘collectively’, rather than having a single ‘Team Leader’ probably proved to be the wrong choice in hindsight. This again ties into communication being an opportunity - increased clarity on group responsibilities beyond just producing work, and group expectations, will help iron out some of the consistency issues the team faced.</li>
    <li>Another challenge was editing the work to read consistently across the assignment, as though it were produced by one team rather than five individuals. While most of the work submitted was of similar quality, accounting for individual differences will certainly require more attention from our group moving forward.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The encouraging part of this is that the main takeaways are all positive - the team worked comfortably together and produced quality work in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Knowing our opportunities (Organisation, Communication and clarity of Roles and Expectations) moving forward will allow us to account for them early and set ourselves up for success in the next assignments.</p>
