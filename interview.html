  <h1 align="center">A glimpse into the work life of an IT Architect</h1>
  <p>I had the opportunity to interview Ryan Worsfold. Ryan is a technical architect with Zendesk which is a software company. Ryan’s role specifically sits under the professional services team as a technical architect. Ryan’s day to day job consists of collecting and understanding the client’s requirements then providing recommendations based on their needs as well as producing documentations such as solution design, key design decisions and solution architecture reference.</p>
  <p>Ryan has been in this industry for about four years now. He started as a developer and then he transitioned to software and professional services. But before he got into the IT industry Ryan worked in the digital marketing field and he is glad that he made this change of career to the IT world.</p>
  <p>Ryan started initially as self-employed when he first graduated from university, by setting up a development lab with his friend in a house, they have worked on this for about three years, his experience of this was extremely tough but very rewarding. Ryan's current job does not require development skills but having that background still helps him in his day to day tasks.</p>
  <p>Ryan interacts with different teams and stakeholders on a daily basis as part of his architectural role. It starts by dealing with the pre-sale and the sales teams, who handover projects to Ryan’s team once a deal has been sealed. During this handover Ryan’s team try to collect all the information about the new clients and understand all their requirements to make sure the clients have an easy and seamless transition.</p>
  <p>Once Ryan’s part of the game is completed, he and his team do a handover to the support team who will be taking care of the client from then on. If a customer faces an issue with a Zendesk product that the support team was not able to solve, then the support team can escalate the case to Ryan’s team.</p>
  <p>Then there is the success team who are responsible for making sure to keep the clients happy and to continue using Zendesk products by having regular meetings with them.</p>
  <p>What Ryan finds challenging in the IT industry unlike other industries it changes all the time, so you need to constantly upskill your self to stay in the game. Which is a challenge that you always must put the efforts into, but he also finds it rewarding.</p>
