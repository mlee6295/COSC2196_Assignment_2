        <p class="title" align="center">s3903758</p>
        <p class="title" align="center">Brisbane, Australia</p>
        <p>Rebecca is a multicultural Australian and a proud member of the Wiradjuri tribe. Born and raised in South East Qld, Rebecca’s interest in IT really kicked off in early 2000 when introduced to a game called Petz by a friend and consequently spent many hours surfing ‘the web’ engaging with an active online community, as well as downloading all kinds of extra files and patches to enhance the game experience. Rebecca hopes that studying at RMIT will help her understand many aspects of the IT including programming, website design and code, the cloud, and online security – and how this might lead to a more focused future career path. Rebecca is also a passionate and lifelong horse lover, with a small team of six horses that she cares for and trains for dressage competitions.</p>
