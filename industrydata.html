<h1>Industry Data</h1>
<p>To compare industry data of our chosen future professions most of our jobs are very vital high experience rolls this means we can only get in these roles with future experience and ability   

The job titles for our group's ideal jobs are in order of rank (by burning-glass data)  

Jarrad - security operations engineer    

Paul – a project manager   

Nour - a business analyst     

Martin – systems analyst    

Rebecca marketing executive   

The industry looks for these skills as a whole,  

A high level of personable interaction these top skills from employers are looking for as follows are communication skills problem solving followed by organization skills this would suggest they are looking for people who are better at working in a team then coding cause fewer issues in a team means more effective team.  

The burning-glass data suggests the top generic skills used in most information technology workplaces today are communication skills followed by problem-solving and organization skills as my role as an operations engineer is has a heavy part of communication to people and having a high level of communication.  

The burning-glass data suggests the most in-demand specialist skills are as follows SQL takes a clear number one followed by JavaScript followed by java itself and trailing behind is skills within the bounds of using Microsoft Windows, and then followed by project management.  

  

The skills that are required the least in our chosen ideal jobs are chosen by burning-glass data suggests that the least important skills are decision making being an avid self-starter and being verbally articulate, which is an interesting conclusion due to all our jobs having a high need for these specific skill sets involved in a day-to-day basis  

  

Or rolls are heavy soft skill roles in the fact that we must be able to talk and ask people to do what they are asked of us we need to be able to make tough decisions for the company and be able to think on the fly due to the nature of the industry especially in which of cybersecurity since that malicious attacks can happen any time or any hour of the day.  

Many of our jobs have several hard IT skills involved which as well means we will need to be able to code/run levels of coding and net level encryptions depending on the job.   

In conclusion, I can speak for most of us with our ideal jobs being put under the magnifying glass using burning-glass data we still would not change our jobs due to our affinity for such a position, despite some skills in our ideal jobs not all of them are as highly important as we were before anticipating.
