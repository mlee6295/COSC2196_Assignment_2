<h1>Industry Data</h1>
<p>To compare industry data of our chosen future professions most of our jobs are very vital high experience rolls this means we can only get in these roles with future experience and ability  

The job titles for our group's ideal jobs are in order of rank (by burning-glass data) 

Jarrad - security operations engineer   

Paul – a project manager  

Nour - a business analyst    

Martin – systems analyst   

Rebecca marketing executive  

The industry looks for these skills as a whole, 

A high level of personable interaction these top skills from employers are looking for as follows are communication skills problem solving followed by organization skills this would suggest they are looking for people who are better at working in a team then coding cause fewer issues in a team means more effective team. 

The burning-glass data suggests the top generic skills used in most information technology workplaces today are communication skills followed by problem-solving and organization skills as my role as an operations engineer is has a heavy part of communication to people and having a high level of communication. 

The burning-glass data suggests the most in-demand specialist skills are as follows SQL takes a clear number one followed by JavaScript followed by java itself and trailing behind is skills within the bounds of using Microsoft Windows, and then followed by project management. 

 

The skills that are required the least in our chosen ideal jobs are chosen by burning-glass data suggests that the least important skills are decision making being an avid self-starter and being verbally articulate, which is an interesting conclusion due to all our jobs having a high need for these specific skill sets involved in a day-to-day basis 

 

Or rolls are heavy soft skill roles in the fact that we must be able to talk and ask people to do what they are asked of us we need to be able to make tough decisions for the company and be able to think on the fly due to the nature of the industry especially in which of cybersecurity since that malicious attacks can happen any time or any hour of the day. 

Many of our jobs have several hard IT skills involved which as well means we will need to be able to code/run levels of coding and net level encryptions depending on the job.  

In conclusion, I can speak for most of us with our ideal jobs being put under the magnifying glass using burning-glass data we still would not change our jobs due to our affinity for such a position, despite some skills in our ideal jobs not all of them are as highly important as we were before anticipating.

<h2>Paul:</h2>
  <h3>Ideal Jobs:</h3>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Rebecca – Marketing Executive</li>
    <li>Martin – Systems Analyst</li>
    <li>Nour – Business Analyst</li>
    <li>Paul – Project Manager</li>
    <li>Jarrad – Operation Engineer</li>
  </ul>
<p>As outlined in the previous page, common amongst all our ideal roles are many ‘soft-skills’ – Communication, Organisation and Teamwork for example. This is a reflection of the roles we’ve selected being primarily people-focused rather than hard technical. Of these soft skills, Communication is far and away the most in demand according job listings in a Burning Glass Technologies analysis (2018). Also making a significant showing on the same report are Problem Solving and Organisational Skills (number 2 and 3 respectively) – again mirroring a common requirement in the jobs we’ve selected.</p>
<p>In terms of the more industry-specific, ‘hard-skills’, we started to see more variance across the roles. Reflecting its large and growing importance, Cloud was the only skill common to all. While the Burning Glass report doesn’t explicitly list ‘Cloud’ as a skill, the top skills (coding languages SQL, JavaScript and Java) do inadvertently suggest cloud – few databases would be separate from some sort of cloud infratstructure (SQL and JavaScript is a critical language for web-based applications. A more recent article by recruiting firm Hays does however explicitly list ‘Cloud Engineers’ as the number one in-demand skill in IT for 2021 in Australia (_REFERENCE_). Cloud is also mentioned (via specific engineering roles) along with cybersecurity in LinkedIn’s ‘Jobs on the Rise in 2021’ report as areas in-demand roles for IT professionals (_REFERENCE_).</p>
<p>On hard-skills alone, this puts Jarrad’s role as the most in-demand with the jobs skills of security and JavaScript being explicitly called out. It is difficult to extrapolate out a ranking though from this report alone, as if we look at Burning Glass’s Top Titles report, this suggests Project Management (Paul) and Graphic Design (Rebecca) as the most in-demand. Nour and Martin’s roles cannot be discounted either as their required skills and job titles also feature highly across both reports. For the sake of rankings, Nour & Martin’s roles will be ranked together as highlighted in our IT Jobs section, they bear the most similarity in skills required. Both also are roles that cover a wide range of what’s available in information technology.</p>
<p>Using Burning Glass’ data alone, the demand ranking might look like this:</p>
<p>Ranked on Hard-Skills:</p>
  <ol class="list">
    <li>Jarrad – Operations Engineer</li>
    <li>Paul – Project Management</li>
    <li>Nour & Martin – Analysts</li>
    <li>Rebecca – Marketing Executive</li>
  </ol>
<p>Ranked on Job Title:</p>
  <ol class-"list">
    <li>Paul – Project Management</li>
    <li>Rebecca – Marketing Executive</li>
    <li>Jarrad – Operations Engineers</li>
    <li>Nour & Martin - Analysts</li>
  </ol>
<p>Interesting and important to note is that across both metrics, all our selected roles and skills appear in the top 10 across both reports.</p>
<p>Specialised skills that are missing from our selected jobs that are highly in demand according to the same datasets include:</p>
  <ul class-"list">
    <li>SQL, JavaScript, Java, C#, Python – skills in specific coding languages.</li>
    <li>SAP, Windows, Linux, Office – skills in specific software.</li>
    <li>ITIL, SCRUM, Git – skills in specific IT methodoligies.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Thankfully, on reflecting upon this, we all feel that we’re in the right place! The further into our studies we go within IT, the more we will naturally gravitate and specialise in specific platforms and coding languages. Methodologies like ITIL and SCRUM will also be something we inevitably some in contact with as we begin our careers and experience workplaces that follow these processes.</p>
<p>Of more generalised skills, with Communication, Problem Solving, Organisational Skills, Writing and Teamwork dominating the Burning Glass report, we are well represented in what we’ve identified in our dream roles. One amazing resource we have found for developing these skills is the book ‘FYI – For Your Improvement’ by Michael M. Lombardo, Robert W. Eichinger, the book behind the ‘Lominger Competencies’.</p>
<p>In discussion after analysing the data, none of us have changed our view on our potential paths, goals or roles. Perhaps we’re cheating but we’ve all selected roles that cover broad enough territory as to be able to find work. That is, if the future lies solely in (for example) machine learning – all our roles can take advantage of this reality. What we have taken from this is the importance of being open to changing directions and developments as we go furhter into information technology – finding our areas  of interest and specialisation with an open mind to applying the gained skills laterally if needed.</p>
